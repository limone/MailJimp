### MailChimp API for Java

#### About

This fork is adapted from the original.  My goal is to add in some missing service calls surrounding templates and campaigns.

#### Original About.

MailJimp is a MailChimp library built in Java intended for use within Maven-enabled Spring-based applications.  MailJimp was tested against version 1.3 of the MailChimp API though most of the methods will work with version 1.2. (But I really don't know why you would use it ;)
The Maven part is not mandatory, of course - feel free to download the source and build yourself the library.  The Spring part is also not mandatory, as long as you deploy the library in a container that understands the `@PostConstruct` annotation, or you manually invoke `MailJimpService::init()` after construction.

#### Runtime Info

To run the service in a Spring-based application you have to do two things:

1. Integrate the config file `mailjimp-spring-config.xml` in your app. It is part of the distro and can be found in the classpath.

		<import resource="classpath:mailjimp-spring-config.xml" />

2. Create a file called `mailjimp.properties` and add it to the classpath. This file is used to configure the MailChimpService and has the following entries:

		mj.username=your_username
		mj.password=your_password
		mj.apiKey=your_api_key
		mj.apiVersion=version_to_use (1.3 is the current one)
		mj.ssl=https (true|false)

	An example of this file can be found under `/src/test/resources/mailjimp.properties` which is used for the integration tests.


#### Test Info

If you want to run the integration tests (`mailjimp.service.TestMailChimpService`) and have them work properly, you need to edit the files `/src/test/resources/mailjimp.properties` and `/src/test/resources/mailjimp-test.properties`.
In the later one you need to set the id of an existing list and an email address of an already subscribed user of that list.

#### Maven

MailJimp deploys releases and snapshots to Sonatype's OSS repository.  Releases are automatically synchronized with Maven Central so no repository information should be required.  To use our most recent release, please add the following dependency:
